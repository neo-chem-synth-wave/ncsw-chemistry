# NeoChemSynthWave: Chemistry
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ncsw__chemistry-v.2024.06.1-%23E0457B?logo=github&style=flat)

Over the last decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has slowly re-emerged as a heavily researched subject in
Chemoinformatics. Even though the idea of utilizing computers for chemical synthesis has existed for as long as
computers themselves, the high level of reliability and innovation expected of such approaches has been repeatedly
proven difficult to achieve. In recent years, however, utilizing machine learning has proven particularly promising,
with novel approaches emerging frequently. Therefore, considering the interdisciplinary nature of the subject,
providing essential programming utilities to researchers from various backgrounds is paramount to maximizing success.
The main objective of the **NeoChemSynthWave: Chemistry** project is to achieve that by developing, documenting, and
maintaining a comprehensive set of the most relevant computer-assisted chemical synthesis utilities within a single
Python package.


## Installation
The [***ncsw_chemistry***](/ncsw_chemistry) package can be utilized as follows:

- [Utilizing Code Snippets of Interest](#utilizing-code-snippets-of-interest)
- [Creating a New Environment](#creating-a-new-environment)
- [Installing on an Existing Environment](#installing-on-an-existing-environment)


### Utilizing Code Snippets of Interest
The [***ncsw_chemistry***](/ncsw_chemistry) package is an organized collection of utility classes, which means that the
static methods are applicable outside the class context as long as all dependencies are satisfied. Therefore, utilizing
only code snippets of interest is an appropriate strategy to avoid the installation altogether.


### Creating a New Environment
A new environment for the [***ncsw_chemistry***](/ncsw_chemistry) package can be set up using package management tools
like [**Conda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) or [**Mamba**](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest) as follows:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate ncsw-chemistry
```

```shell
mamba env create -f environment.yaml

mamba activate ncsw-chemistry
```


### Installing on an Existing Environment
The [***ncsw_chemistry***](/ncsw_chemistry) package can be installed on an existing environment using the package
installer tool [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) as follows:

```shell
pip install -e .
```
