Welcome to the **NeoChemSynthWave: Chemistry** project repository !!!

Over the last decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has slowly re-emerged as a heavily researched subject in
Chemoinformatics. Even though the idea of utilizing computers to tackle chemical synthesis has existed for as long as
computers themselves, the high level of reliability and innovation expected of such approaches has been repeatedly
proven difficult to achieve. In recent years, machine learning approaches have proven particularly promising.
