Over the last decade, computer-assisted chemical synthesis has re-emerged as a heavily researched subject in
Chemoinformatics. Even though the idea of utilizing computers to assist chemical synthesis has existed for nearly as
long as computers themselves, the expected blend of reliability and innovation has repeatedly been proven difficult to
achieve. Nevertheless, recent machine learning approaches have exhibited the potential to address these shortcomings.
Considering the interdisciplinary nature of such approaches, providing essential chemistry programming utilities to
researchers from various backgrounds is paramount to maximizing success. The main objective of the
**NeoChemSynthWave: Chemistry** project is to provide such programming utilities in a single, comprehensive Python
package.


## Installation
A minimal virtual environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands
as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/ncsw-chemistry.git

cd ncsw-chemistry

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate ncsw-chemistry-env
```

The [ncsw_chemistry](/ncsw_chemistry) package can be locally installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command as
follows:

```shell
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```
